# KNN Classifier

This project is a Java implementation of the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm to deal with classifying the famous iris.txt dataset. The program takes in two user inputs, the k value and the training/testing split for the iris dataset. It uses the 4 known data points to predict the class name out of the three options {Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica}. The results of the classification are saved to the results text file, along with the accuracy of the classification.
